# 👤 PoseNet AR Filter with ml5.js and p5.js

This project is a real-time human pose detection web app using the PoseNet model from ml5.js and visual rendering via p5.js. The app uses webcam input to detect body keypoints and overlays fun AR-style assets (e.g., Shahrukh Khan face and smoke effect) on the user's nose.
